# Mango
Have you recently begun getting tired of the simplicity of Python? Have you longed for a more sophisticated programming language? Many tried, and failed, but *I* am proud to unveil **Mango** `v1.0.0`, a programming language with all the features of Python, but none of the ease-of-use! 

## Writing code in Mango
Mango files are given the file extension `.mango`. Mango is a very simple language, provided that you know Python, and have two websites at your disposal (https://www.browserling.com/tools/text-repeat & https://www.ascii-code.com/). The key of Mango's brilliance lies in the number of `a`'s used. Our groundbreaking compiler converts this number into the corresponding ASCII character. Each iteration of `mango` has to end with a `!`, to signify the end of the current character.

For example, this *would* be proper Mango code:

`mango!Maaaango!Maaaango!maango!maaaaaaaaaaango!
maaaaango!Maaaaaaango!`

(As you can see, the capitalisation on the m is irrelevant, provided that each `mango` ends with a `!`.)

The file then gets *compiled.* Although our compiler is universal, meaning it can be translated into any language (using ASCII characters), both programming and linguistic, it's only so far been used to convert `.mango` into `.py`.

## Using the Mango Compiler
Run `mango.py` in the directory your `.mango` script is in. You will be greated with the innovative Mango commandline, full of bugs and hardships left and right. Simply run `compile [mangofile].mango [pythonfile].py` for the Mango Compiler to slowly (& painfully) convert your `.mango` file into the inferior `.py` format. 

## Examples
An example of `print("hi")` written in `.mango` can be found in the `Examples` folder. To compile it yourself, run `compile hi.mango hi.py`, provided that you have downloaded `mango.py`.

## License
Why would you want this anyway? 

Do anything you want I guess.
